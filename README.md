## About Me

I work on a lot of things including non-equilibrium fluid dynamics, cosmology (large scale structure and scalar field dark matter), machine learning, distributed systems, smart contracts, (financial) derivatives.

In my spare time, I like to mess around with AI and 3D modelling.

Languages and tools:

* Proficient in Rust (6+ years)
* Proficient in Python (4+ years) as well as data science tools (numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, dask)
* DevOps: Terraform / Docker / K8S / AWS
* Database: Postgres
* Smart Contract: Solana (25k lines of code)
